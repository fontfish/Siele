# Siele

An unfinished typeface.

![A sample of Siele in its current form.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fontfish/Siele/main/Siele_sample.png "Siele")

I had hoped to bring this type to a state nearer to completion before
making it public, but figured I might as well do so now.
I have yet to get the the spacing to a point that I am happy with,
and much tidying is necessary, but the design is roughly as I want it.

For now, the file names are as they were, and this was originally intended
to be a proof of concept in the design of another face. I will edit the
names in due course.

## Design

This face is based on various Garamonds, reinvented in search of a slab-like
simplicity but without the monotonous feel of most slab serifs.
It has been designed with long text in mind, but in its current state is
likely more suitable for larger use cases.

## Files

- test.sfd is the main design file for the roman. Glyphs should be migrated from here to test_spacing.sfd once the bulk of the spacing has been done in that file.

- test_spacing.sfd is where I am currently working on spacing, along with a few other edits to make the face more suitable for its intended sizes of use.

- test_italic.sfd is a rough basis for a more modern and readable italic counterpart.

- test-i.sfd is the original, more “Garamondian”, italic.

For the time being, all the files are disorganised – they were initially
only a side-project in the corner of another folder of design work.

## 3D Print Experiments

I have successfully 3D printed some moveable type sorts (at approx. 14pt)
with this face. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to do so while
keeping the type exactly square and exactly the right height (I thought I
had it, but a short line of text showed some bowing), but the letterfaces
are functional for printing.

I will add some pictures of this at some point.

## Naming

The name has no particular reasoning behind it. It was cobbled together
almost at random simply because I liked the look of it, though it does
appear to be a word in some languages.

I would like to dedicate this typeface to all those who stand against
violence, who stand against authoritarianism, and who hope for a peaceful
and sustainable tomorrow.
My heart is with all those protesting against war and all those whose
lives are in danger because of it.

## License

I will add the SIL Open Font License to this typeface in due course.
