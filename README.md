An unfinished typeface.

I had hoped to bring this type to a state nearer to completion before making it public, but today the world is a scary place, and it seems possible there will never be another chance to do so. I have never managed to get the the spacing to a point that I am happy with, and much tidying is necessary, but the design is roughly as I want it.

This face is based on various Garamonds, reinvented in search of a slab-like simplicity but without the monotonous feel of most slab serifs. It has been designed with long text in mind, but in its current state is likely more suitable for larger use cases.

I have successfully 3D printed some moveable type sorts (at approx. 14pt) with this face. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to do so while keeping the type exactly square and exactly the right height (I thought I had it, but a short line of text showed some bowing), but the letterfaces are functional. It has been an interesting experiment, and with a little more adjustment and maybe some extra steps could produce usable movable type.

This typeface is for all those who stand against violence, who stand against authoritarianism, and who hope for a peaceful and sustainable tomorrow. My heart is with all those protesting against war and all those whose lives are in danger because of it.
