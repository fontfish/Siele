# Siele

An unfinished typeface.

![A sample of Siele in its current form.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fontfish/Siele/main/Siele_sample.png "Siele")

I had hoped to bring this type to a state nearer to completion before making it public, but figured I might as well do so now. I have yet to get the the spacing to a point that I am happy with, and much tidying is necessary, but the design is roughly as I want it.

## Design

This face is based on various Garamonds, reinvented in search of a slab-like simplicity but without the monotonous feel of most slab serifs. It has been designed with long text in mind, but in its current state is likely more suitable for larger use cases.

## 3D Print Experiments

I have successfully 3D printed some moveable type sorts (at approx. 14pt) with this face. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to do so while keeping the type exactly square and exactly the right height (I thought I had it, but a short line of text showed some bowing), but the letterfaces are functional for printing.

I will add some pictures of this at some point.

## Naming

The name has no particular reasoning behind it. It was cobbled together almost at random simply because I liked the look of it, though it does appear to be a word in some languages.

I would like to dedicate this typeface to all those who stand against violence, who stand against authoritarianism, and who hope for a peaceful and sustainable tomorrow. My heart is with all those protesting against war and all those whose lives are in danger because of it.

## License

I will add the SIL Open Font License to this typeface.
