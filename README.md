# Siele

An unfinished typeface.

![A sample of Siele in its current form.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fontfish/Siele/main/resources/Siele_sample.png "Siele")

A work still very much in production.
I have yet to polish the spacing to a point that I am happy with,
and some tidying is necessary, but the design is roughly as I want it.

For now, the file names are as they have been for development, as this was
originally intended to be a proof of concept in the design of another face.
I will edit the names in due course.

## Design

This face is based on various Garamonds, reinvented in search of a slab-like
simplicity without becoming a slab serif design.
It has been designed with text in mind, but in its current state is perhaps
more suitable for use in larger sizes.

## Files

- test.sfd is the main design file for the roman. Glyphs should be migrated from here to test_spacing.sfd once the bulk of the spacing has been finalised in that file.

- test_spacing.sfd is where I am currently working on spacing, along with a few other edits to make the face more suitable for its intended sizes of use.

- test_italic.sfd is a rough basis for a more modern and readable italic counterpart.

- test-i.sfd is the original, more “Garamondian”, italic.

For the time being, all the files are disorganised – this is predominantly
a personal project that grew into something more complex,
and will likely remain treated as such.

## 3D Print Experiments

I have successfully 3D printed some moveable type sorts (at approx. 14pt)
with this face. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to do so while
keeping the type exactly square and exactly the right height, though the
letterfaces are functional for printing.

I will add some pictures of this soon.

## Goals

Many of the goals for this face are long-term.
They may be carried out slowly, if at all.

- [ ] An accompanying italic.
- [ ] An accompanying bold.
- [ ] A greater range of accented glyphs for increased language support.
- [ ] Variable font weight.

## Naming

The name has no particular reasoning behind it. It was cobbled together
almost at random simply because I liked the look of it, though it does
appear to be a word in some languages.

I would like to dedicate this typeface to all those who stand against
violence, who stand against authoritarianism, and who hope for a peaceful
and sustainable tomorrow.
My heart is with all those protesting against war and all those whose
lives are in danger because of it.

## License

I plan to add the SIL Open Font License to this typeface in due course.
