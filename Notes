# Notes and To-Do


## Steps

- Add 34 encoding slots for smallcaps letters.
  - A to Z, Þ, Ð, Ø, Æ, Œ, Ĳ, ẞ, [one spare]
- Add 6 encoding slots for smallcap accents
  (these should be a little shorter than the lower-case versions).
  - `, ´, ˆ, ˇ, ˝






### TO-DO:

* [ ] Check all ink traps and make consistent. 3px in capitals, 2px in lower-case. (Done to end of italic lower-case..)
* [ ] Counterspace of ð is a little big. (Edited a little.)
* [ ] Slightly reduce all alphabet spacing?! (About 2 px either side?)
* [ ] Add “fþ” and “ffþ” ligatures?
* [ ] Add all ligatures to features.
* [ ] Punctuation and number kerning!
* [ ] Double-check all numbers for evenness of weight.
* [ ] Finish smallcap-cap kerning!
* [ ] Check all (all!) letter-punctuation kern pairs for consistency.
