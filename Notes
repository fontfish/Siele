W, X a bit too heavy in smallcaps? And in upper-case? (Modified slightly.)


TO-DO:

* [ ] Check all ink traps and make consistent. 3px in capitals, 2px in lower-case. (Done to end of italic lower-case..)
* [ ] Some letters are kerned with “all”. Fix this!
* [ ] Make italic (separate file) n, m, i, h and j a little thinner. (Which one?)
* [ ] Counterspace of ð is a little big. (Edited a little.)
* [ ] Slightly reduce spacing of uncurved letters? i, l, u, etc.
  * [ ] Start by taking just a little off the left side of letters like i and n?
* [ ] SLIGHTLY REDUCE ALL ALPHABET SPACING?! (About 2 px either side?)
* [ ] Add “fþ” and “ffþ” ligatures?
* [ ] Add all ligatures to features.
* [ ] Punctuation and number kerning!
* [ ] Redesign numbers? Specifically old-style proportional 5 and tabular 6 and 9. Double-check all for weight.
* [ ] Kerning for Capital overhangs is inconsistent. Output and check, modify, check, etc.
* [ ] Finish smallcap-cap kerning!
* [ ] Check all (all!) letter-punctuation kern pairs for consistency.
